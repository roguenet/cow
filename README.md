Starling layout and styling atop Flashbang

As lightweight an approach as I can manage to doing simple layout of blocks in a flashbang-starling
environment. The goal here is not to provide an all-singing all-dancing UI toolkit, but to do
something that is minimal but useful for UI in games.

Because I use them, framed also uses these choice libraries:
 * [Starling](https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework)
 * [Flashbang-starling](https://github.com/tconkling/flashbang-starling)
 * [Aspire](https://github.com/tconkling/aspire) (dependency of flashbang-starling)
 * [React-as3](https://github.com/tconkling/react-as3) (also a dep of flashbang-starling)
 * [Feathers](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers) (not a dependency - A couple of one-off
classes taken from this excellent Starling UI framework)
