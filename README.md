Collection of Widgets - lightweight Starling UI

A couple of widgets that are useful for unencumbered UI. I'm not going to try to make them do everything; 
just what I need or is requested of me. Because I use them, cow also uses these choice libraries:
 * [Starling](https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework)
 * [Flashbang-starling](https://github.com/tconkling/flashbang-starling)
 * [Aspire](https://github.com/tconkling/aspire) (dependency of flashbang-starling)
 * [React-as3](https://github.com/tconkling/react-as3) (also a dep of flashbang-starling)
 * [Feathers](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers) (not a dependency - A couple of one-off classes taken from this excellent Starling UI framework)
